boringproxy development is sponsored by [TakingNames.io](https://takingnames.io).
boringproxy offers full integration with TakingNames.io, providing the simplest
way to get up and running with your own domain. More information [here](https://takingnames.io/blog/introducing-takingnames-io),
and a demo video of boringproxy working with TakingNames.io [here](https://youtu.be/9hf72-fYTts).

# What is boringproxy?

<!--
You're using it right now! The website you're reading is hosted on my home
computer, through boringproxy.
-->

`boringproxy` is a combination of a reverse proxy and a tunnel manager.

What that means is if you have a self-hosted web service (Nextcloud, Emby,
Jellyfin, etherpad, personal website, etc.) running on a private network (such as behind a
[NAT] at home), boringproxy aims to provide the easiest way to securely (i.e.
HTTPS and optional password-protection) expose that server to the internet, so you can
access it from anywhere.

To see how boringproxy compares to other similar software, see the
[comparison here](/tunneling-comparison/).

The main features are:

* 100% free and open source under the MIT license.
* Designed from the ground up with self-hosters in mind.
* No more port forwarding, NAT traversal, firewall rules, HTTPS certificate
  management, etc etc. Let boringproxy handle it all for you.
* No config files. Seriously, none. It has nice defaults and the few knobs are
  easily adjusted with simple CLI parameters.
* Lightning fast web GUI for managing tunnels from one central place. It even
  works great on mobile browsers.
* Fully configurable through a HTTP API.
* The client software works on Linux, Windows, Mac, and ARM (i.e. Raspberry Pi
  and Android).
* Ships as single executable which contains both the server and client.
* SSH under the hood. You can use a standard SSH client if you prefer.
* End-to-end encryption (since version 0.4.0). Choose whether to terminate TLS
  at the server, client, or your application. All handled seamlessly with
  Let's Encrypt integration.

# Installation

Learn more about the [installation](/installation/) in the documentation.

`boringproxy` uses the DNS to identify the server and the tunnel endpoints. An often used pattern is to provide a domain record for the administrative web interface, and a wildcard subdomain for the tunneled services.

* `bpdemo.brng.pro` - the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the host where boringproxy will be running.
* `*.bpdemo.brng.pro` - a wildcard subdomain for effortless domain mapping of clients

The clients will then be able to assign domains from the wildcard subdomain without having to reconfigure DNS beforehand.

# Getting Help

If you run into problems running boringproxy, the best place to ask for help is
over at the [IndieBits][0] community, where we have a [dedicated section][1] for
boringproxy support. If you think you've found a bug, or want to discuss
development, please [open an issue][github] on GitHub.


# What's with the name?

The name has two meanings; one pun and one philosophy. The pun is "bore" as in
bore a hole/tunnel, highlighting the fact that boringproxy is a reverse proxy
that automatically manages making tunnels.

The philosophy is that boring (as in boredom) software is often the most useful
software.  If you have to interact with boringproxy to get something done, I
hope it ends up being the least interesting part of your day. I want it to be a
tool that does its job well and gets out of the way.

This also has implications when it comes to adding features. I want boringproxy
to remain simple and focused. When contemplating adding any feature, the first
question I ask myself is: is it boring enough?
